Water Potability Prediction

Introduction

This project aims to predict the potability of water using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used is water_potability.csv, which contains features related to water quality. The script includes data preprocessing, handling missing values, removing outliers, addressing class imbalance using SMOTE, and applying several classification algorithms to predict water potability.
